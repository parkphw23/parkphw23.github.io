                    I once served as a lifeguard at Shilla Hotel, 5-star hotel in Jong-ro, Seoul. <br>
                    It was during the summer of 2018.<br />
                    As I was not a boy who went out a lot or be social, I thought to be more interactive with people.<br />
                    Honestly, lifeguard seemed like an awesome fit for me. I am good at swimming, and the job itself can give me some pride about saving lives.
                    <br /> So I got my red cross certificate and applied for a job.<br />
                    It was the first time feeling taxpayer's side. It was fun to go to work, and I've learned that people are important. <br />
                    I've learned a lot from communication skills and dedication as the job requires full alert during your shift.

                    I, Hyun Wook Park, am a strong, responsible person. I love to work out, watch dramas, and listen to music. <br />
                    I've dedicated a section of my webstie for my favorite dramas and actors. I am watching Breaking Bad on netflix.
                    <br />
                    I usually listen to lo=fi hip hop or jazz. <br />
                    
                    I am also interested in many things, which now caused me to learn programming by taking CS50 from Edx.
